1. Open solution file in VS2010
2. Compile and run. 

Notes: 
in Program.cs "GenerateTestItems" method generates a test collection of Items.

Assumptions: 
1. No validation is required for dependencies objects
2. No comments in a code due to a code simplicity 
3. Item object 'category' can not be changed after object is created
